## 💡Tips !
🌐 Check Dependencies: Install required Python libraries before running the script.  
⚡ Use a Secure Key: For AES, 3DES, and RSA, make sure to use a valid key or generate one before decryption.     
🔄 Ensure Proper Formatting: Input data correctly based on the selected conversion type.  

## 🤝Follow the Prompts !
1) Run the script  
2) Choose the desired conversion type from the menu.  
3) Enter your data when prompted.  
4) View the converted result instantly!  
 
## ⚙️Troubleshooting

1) `Issue: Encoding/Decoding Errors?:`  
- Ensure the input data is in the correct format for the chosen conversion.  

2) `Issue: Missing Libraries?:`  
- read the requirements.txt file, (cat requirements.txt) or (gedit requirements.txt).  

3) `Issue: Permission Denied?:`  
- try with sudo.  

4) `Issue: Python3 or pip not found?:`  
- read the requirements.txt file, (cat requirements.txt) or (gedit requirements.txt).  

5) `Issue: RSA Key Issues?:`  
- Make sure to use the correct private/public keys for encryption and decryption.
